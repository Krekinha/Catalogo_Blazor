# 7.1 Managing Authentication and Authorization

|![](img/07-a1.jpg)| Authentication is used to identify a user's identity<br/> It is in authentication that the user proves who he is |
|![](img/07-a2.jpg)| Authorization is used to determine what an authenticated<br/> user can access and what actions he can take |

`ASP.NET Core` supports configuration and security management in `Blazor` applications  
Security scenarios are different for `Blazor Server` and `Blazor WebAssembly` projects  
In `Blazor Server` projects, authorization checks are able to determine:    
- The user interface options presented to the user 
- Access rules for application areas and components

In `Blazor WebAssembly` projects authorization is used **only** to determine which user interface options will be presented  
A `WebAssembly` application cannot enforce authorization access rules

### Blazor Server: Authentication
`Blazor` uses existing `ASP.NET Core` authentication mechanisms to establish the user's identity  
`Blazor Server` applications operate over a real-time connection that is created using `SignalR`  
The `Blazor Server App` template allows you to configure the authentication mechanism  
Authentication uses _cookies_ or another process to determine the user's identity and uses the same mechanism as `ASP.NET Core` applications  
The project can track the identity of the logged in user and apply authorization rules

### Blazor WebAssembly: Authentication
In `Blazor WebAssembly` projects authentication checks can be ignored because all client-side code can be modified by the user  
We can implement a custom `AuthenticationStateProvider` service for `Blazor WebAssembly` applications  
`AuthenticationStateProvider` is an internal service that obtains authentication status data from `HttpContext.User` from `ASP.NET Core`  
It is used by the `AuthorizeView` and `CascadingAuthenticationState` components to obtain the authentication state  

### Blazor WebAssembly: Configuring the project for Authentication
1. In the _Client_ project, import the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Authorization` package
2. Include in the `_imports.razor` file of the `Client` project the reference to the `@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Authorization` _namespace_
3. Include in the `Startup` class of the _Client_ project, in the _ConfigureServices_ method, the authorization service _services.AddAuthorizationCore()_
